# Delaunay-Centroid-Voronoi Playground

This is a playground to visualize delaunay triangulation, its voronoi dual mesh and a barycentric dual mesh with centroids instead of circumcenters done with d3-delaunay. This takes heavy inspiration from [this](https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1721-voronoi-alternative/) and [this](https://observablehq.com/@redblobgames/centroid-and-voronoi-polygons) post by redblobgames.

### For the future
- Try out incenter dual mesh
